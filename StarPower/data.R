# NBA All-star game

# Questions to investigate:
# When is the game played? 3rd Sunday of February (midpoint of NBA season)
# How are players chosen? Currently, 50% fans vote, 25% each for media and player
# - Starting 2026, voting not limited to position
# - 12 players from each conference picked (East vs. West)

# Other interesting things:
# The games tend to be more 'showy', less defense, more impressive shots, etc.
# Players do get paid, and money also goes to charity
