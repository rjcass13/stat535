# Obs 53 and 74 stick out, but maybe not outliers
# Interaction of yr_built and eff_age
# Interaction of area, yr_bult
# Interaction of gar, yr_built
# area/lot/yr_built have positive relationship with price, age has negative

# Expected Relationship
# Lot, area, baths, gar, floors, basement, const, roof, quality yr_built: positive
# eff_age: negative

# Expected interactions: 
# lot/area, perhaps also combined with house add-ons (baths, gar, floors, bsmt)
# the quality values: const, roof, quality
# yr_built, eff_age

# Expected Non-linear?
# perhaps area/lot with price. I don't think I expect that to be linear, maybe something that starts to plateau after a while
# perhaps the quality metrics as well (though they are ordinal so maybe can't just call it linear anyway)
# probably yr_built/eff_age. Be surprised is it's just linear. Maybe after a certain age it's just 'old'
